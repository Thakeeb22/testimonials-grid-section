## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

In this challenge i was able to learn how to put both background color and background image in the same box and position it to my satisfaction and even resize it

```css
.clifford {
  grid-column-start: span 2;
  background-color: hsl(263, 55%, 52%);
  background-image: url("./images/bg-pattern-quotation.svg");
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  background-position: 80% 25%;
  background-size: 150px;
}
```

### Continued development

I hope to continue learning how to use css Grid and Flexbox to build responsive and mobile friendly websites

### Useful resources

- [Resource 1](https://www.youtube.com) - This helped me for learning more about the css grid and flexbox layout. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
